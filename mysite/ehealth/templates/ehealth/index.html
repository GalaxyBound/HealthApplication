          <p>Reater stands for Real Time Emergency Responder. This revolutionary application allows patients to be monitored for Myocardial Infarction. It measures the following different vitals of the patinets to give overall and specific data on the patient in real time.</p>

          <p>ECG: This is used to get the patient's Heart Rate.</p>
          <p>Temperature Sensor: This is used to get the patient's body temperature</p>
          <p>ECG: This is used to monitor the patient's Blood Oxygen Saturation Levels</p>

          <p>The system is used by both Patients and Responders. Responders are registered and are notified if anyone in their local area is in need of assistance. They are also given a map of where they are located and where the nearest ADEs are.
             The system has built in functions for the patients so that if they collapse the system will automatically call emergency services.
          </p>

          <p>There are a few main problems that this application addresses:</p>

          <p>1. Response Time </p>
          <p>2. Allows Basic care to be given until help arrives</p>
          <p>3. Improves accessibility of AEDs</p>
